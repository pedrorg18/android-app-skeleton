# Basic skeleton / template Android app (Github Browser)

This is a sample Android application that could be used as a template. 
The current sample behaviour allows users to search for GitHub repositories and view their details.

## Technical Choices

* **UI:** Jetpack Compose for building a modern and declarative UI.
* **Networking:** Retrofit for making API calls to GitHub.
* **Data handling:** Kotlin Coroutines and Flows for asynchronous operations and data streams.
* **Testing:**
    * Unit tests for ViewModels and other components using JUnit and kotlinx-coroutines-test.
    * UI tests for Compose using Jetpack Compose testing framework.
